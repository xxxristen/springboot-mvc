# Java Spring Boot MVC App 	- Assessment
 
This is my GitHub repository for my Java Spring Boot MVC app assessment.

### Review questions ###

**1. What did you like about this project?**

   It allowed me to gain new knowledge and also understand about the importance of validation and exception handling.

**2. What did you struggle with in this project?**

   The project was tough as I had problems with the sequencing of the validation and exception handling. For the case of updating a task, I'm hoping to throw an exception if task id doesn't exist then validate if the task's parameters are valid.

**3. What would make your experience with this assessment better?**

   Perhaps to slow down the pace of class and also to share with us the .java classes with comments to explain what they do and when/how the exceptions are called. And also if it's possible, to share with us a model answer to the project so we know how/where to improve.
